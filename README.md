## 📊 Problem Statement

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death globally. Early detection can significantly improve treatment outcomes. However, manual diagnosis based on various factors like blood pressure, cholesterol, and heart rate can be complex and time-consuming. This project leverages machine learning to automate and enhance the prediction process.
